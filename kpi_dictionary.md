# KPI Dictionary — Revenue Optimization & Customer Behavior Analytics

## Purpose

This document defines the key performance indicators (KPIs) and derived analytical variables used throughout the project. Establishing standardized metric definitions ensures consistency, reproducibility, and accurate interpretation of statistical results across all analyses.

---

## 1. Revenue

**Definition:**
Total monetary value generated from completed transactions.

**Formula:**
Revenue = Quantity × UnitPrice

**Aggregation Level:**

* Transaction level
* Customer level
* Country level
* Time period (daily/monthly)

**Business Interpretation:**
Represents total sales generated and serves as the primary performance metric for evaluating business activity.

---

## 2. Valid Transaction Indicator

**Definition:**
Identifies completed purchases excluding cancellations or returns.

**Rule Applied:**

* Invoices beginning with **“C”** represent cancelled transactions.
* Cancelled invoices are excluded from primary revenue analysis.

**Business Rationale:**
Cancelled orders do not represent realized revenue and may distort performance metrics.

---

## 3. Return / Cancellation Handling

**Definition:**
Transactions associated with returns or order cancellations.

**Treatment Approach:**

* Negative quantities or invoices starting with “C” are removed from revenue calculations.
* Alternative analyses may treat returns as negative revenue if required.

**Analytical Impact:**
Ensures revenue reflects finalized customer purchases only.

---

## 4. Average Order Value (AOV)

**Definition:**
Average monetary value per completed transaction.

**Formula:**
AOV = Total Revenue ÷ Number of Unique Invoices

**Business Interpretation:**
Measures customer spending intensity and purchasing behavior.

---

## 5. Customer Purchase Frequency

**Definition:**
Number of completed transactions made by an individual customer.

**Formula:**
Purchase Frequency = Count of Unique Invoices per CustomerID

**Business Interpretation:**
Indicates customer engagement and loyalty level.

---

## 6. Repeat Purchase Flag

**Definition:**
Binary indicator identifying returning customers.

**Logic:**

* Value = 1 → Customer has more than one distinct invoice
* Value = 0 → Customer has only one transaction

**Business Interpretation:**
Used to evaluate customer retention and model repeat purchase probability.

---

## 7. Monthly Revenue

**Definition:**
Total revenue aggregated by transaction month.

**Derived From:**
InvoiceDate field converted into Year–Month format.

**Business Use:**
Supports trend analysis and time-based regression modeling.

---

## 8. Revenue per Customer

**Definition:**
Total revenue generated by an individual customer during the observation period.

**Formula:**
Revenue per Customer = Sum of Revenue grouped by CustomerID

**Business Interpretation:**
Identifies high-value customers contributing disproportionately to revenue.

---

## 9. Country-Level Performance

**Definition:**
Aggregated revenue and transaction metrics grouped by customer country.

**Business Interpretation:**
Enables comparison of geographic market performance using statistical tests and ANOVA.

---

## 10. Profit Proxy (Derived Metric)

**Definition:**
Estimated profitability measure in absence of explicit cost data.

**Assumption:**
Profit Proxy = Revenue × Assumed Margin Rate

**Example Assumption:**
30% operating margin (documented analytical assumption).

**Note:**
Since cost information is unavailable, this proxy enables optimization and decision analysis while maintaining transparency.

---

## 11. Purchase Probability (Model Output)

**Definition:**
Predicted likelihood that a customer makes repeat purchases.

**Derived Using:**
Logistic Regression Model

**Business Interpretation:**
Supports customer retention and targeting strategies.

---

## 12. Data Assumptions & Limitations

* Dataset does not contain explicit product cost or discount variables.
* Profit-related insights rely on proxy assumptions.
* Analysis focuses on completed transactions only.
* CustomerID availability determines retention analysis scope.

---

## Summary

These KPIs establish a standardized analytical framework used throughout descriptive analysis, hypothesis testing, regression modeling, and optimization stages of this project. All statistical interpretations and business recommendations are derived using the definitions documented above.
