# Business Problem: Revenue Optimization & Customer Behavior Analytics

## 1. Company Context

The organization is a UK-based online retail company specializing in gift and specialty merchandise sold through an e-commerce platform. The company serves individual and wholesale customers across multiple international regions. Transactions occur entirely online, generating large volumes of customer purchase and product sales data.

While overall sales volume has increased over time, management lacks clear visibility into the factors driving revenue performance, customer purchasing behavior, and regional profitability differences.

## 2. Problem Statement

Despite consistent revenue growth, leadership has identified variability in customer purchasing patterns and transaction outcomes across countries, products, and time periods. Specifically, the company faces uncertainty regarding:

* Which factors significantly influence revenue generation
* Whether increased transaction volume translates into sustainable business value
* Differences in customer engagement and repeat purchasing behavior across markets

Without statistical validation, current business decisions rely primarily on descriptive reporting rather than data-driven inference.
